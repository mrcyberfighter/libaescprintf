=============
libaescprintf
=============

  This library provides an easy way for formating the output.

  With styles, foreground and background colors.
 
  You either use the raw ANSI escape sequences with the printf family.
 
  Or using the function of this library (take a look at the documentation).

INSTALLATION
------------

Uncompress the tarball then change to the extracted folder and type:

  $ ./configure # System check
  $ make # build the library
  $ sudo make install # Install the library.

  This will perform a system check, building and installing the library.

  :warning: The prefix is arbitrary set to "/usr" (not "/usr/local")
            else it does not work.
        
            Thanks to mail me if you get a BUGFIX.

Compatibility
-------------

  Unfortunately this library is based on the ANSI escape sequences

  not termcap nor termios.

  I hope to find collaborators to get instead the ANSI escapes sequences,
 
  the universal sequences using termcap.
 
  at minimal for what the current library provides.

 
  To produce a lightweight pretty print library.
 
  Thanks for any help.

NOTE
----

  I hope to find collaborators for termcap support.

  So that we can get a simple lightweight library for formating the output

  according to the terminal capabilities.

  Not a chunk library like ncurses.

  This library doesn't work for the background colors on the Apple-terminal:
 
  the old bug concern the background and the linefeed appears on some terminals.

  If you set the background color other than default and set an linefeed
 
  the entire line is background highlighted with the chosen color...

  (but the blinking effect works well with it).
 
  P.S: using the carriage return does not save it.
